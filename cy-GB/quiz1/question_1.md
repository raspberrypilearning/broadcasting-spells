You wrote scripts to `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} a message when a button is clicked.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
broadcast (invisible v)
```

Which script would hide a sprite when the button is clicked?

--- choices ---

- ( )

```blocks3
when I receive [message1 v]
hide
```

 --- feedback ---

 No, this is the default message in Scratch, but it is not the message being sent by the code.

```blocks3
when I receive [hide v]
hide
```

 --- feedback ---

 No, the message that you need to receive is not called 'hide'.

```blocks3
when I receive [invisible v]
hide
```

 --- feedback ---

Yes, that's correct. The `when I receive`{:class="block3events"} block needs to use exactly the same message name as the `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} block.

```blocks3
when I receive [invisable v]
hide
```

 --- feedback ---

 Not quite. Scratch needs your spelling to be really accurate so the message names match. Check carefully.
