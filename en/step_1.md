## Introduction

Make an app where you use a magic wand to turn sprites into toads and grow and shrink them.

You will:
+ Create buttons that `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} messages to other sprites
+ Get multiple sprites to respond when they `receive`{:class="block3events"} the same message
+ Use the `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} editor to reverse sounds

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Broadcasting**</span> and <span style="color: #0faeb0">**receiving**</span> messages is like  call and response pattern in music. Someone calls and others respond when they hear the call. 
</p>
