## Upgrade your project

How will you expand your magical world? You could:
+ Add more characters
+ Add more spells - you could make characters disappear and reappear with `hide`{:class="block3looks"} and `show`{:class="block3looks"}, apply graphic effects or turn them upside down.

Why not swap characters with a friend using the Scratch backpack or by downloading the sprite to a shared area.

You could agree more spells with a friend and both add them to your character. Make sure you both use exactly the same name for the messages you broadcast.
