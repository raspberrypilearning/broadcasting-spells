<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Now it's time for another spell. This time you're going to cast a transformation spell by broadcasting a `toad`{:class="block3events"} message that turns the **Fairy** sprite into a toad!

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click on the **Code** tab and add a `switch costume to`{:class="block3looks"} block to the end of your existing `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} script so the Fairy is in human form when you run your project:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set size to [100] %
+ switch costume to [Fairy-a v]
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add a new script to the **Fairy** sprite to turn into a toad:

```blocks3  
when I receive [toad v]
switch costume to [Fairy-toad-a v]
```

Add a script to the **Wand** sprite to play the `toad`{:class="block3sound"} sound when the toad spell is cast:

when I receive [toad v]
play sound [toad v] until done
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Test that you can turn the **Fairy** into a toad, with a sound effect, when you click the **toad** button. Click on the green flag again to turn the **Fairy** sprite back into a human.
