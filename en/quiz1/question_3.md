Then you duplicated that sound and reversed it so you also had a grow sound. Which project shows the correct results?

 No, this project has a copy of the shrink sound but the soundwave is the same, it hasn't been reversed to create a grow sound.

 Oh dear, this project reversed the shrink sound instead of duplicating it first to create a grow sound.
