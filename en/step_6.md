Duplicate the **Fairy** sprite. 

![](images/duplicate-fairy.png)

Delete the 'Fairy-a' and 'Fairy-toad-a' costumes. You will be left with a 'toad' costume.

Add a costume of your choice to the **new sprite**. 

We chose the **Batter**:

You might want to change the direction the sprite is pointing in. 

**Tip:** If your sprite goes upside down you can change its `rotation-style`{:class="block3motion"} to `left-right` in the Sprite properties pane or using a code block.

When you grow or shrink a sprite, you want the feet to stay in the same place.

--- task ---

First use the **Select** (arrow) tool to draw a rectangle around the costume and then **Group** it. Then drag your character above the crosshair.

Click on the 'toad' costume.

Rename the costume to match your sprite, we used 'Batter-toad-a'.

If the toad costume is facing the opposite way to the main costume you can use 'Flip Horizontal'.

Now you need to make the toad look like the character. Combining two costumes in this way is called a 'mash up'.

--- task ---

You could add a small detail like a splash of colour, or copy and paste sunglasses or a hat in the paint editor.

**Tip:** You can add any costume to your character sprite to copy and paste from it.

**Tip:** You can group all the objects in a costume by selecting them (with the Select tool or <kbd>
Ctrl-a</kbd>) and then clicking 'Group'.

Switch to the **Code** tab for your new sprite.

Change all of the `switch costume`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to use the correct costumes for your new sprite.

You might also want to change the start `size`{:class="block3looks"} of the sprite `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

**Test:** Click on the spell buttons and both characters should respond to the spell broadcasts.

**Debug:** Check that you have changed the costumes in the `switch costume`{:class="block3looks"} blocks for your new sprite.
