<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

```

You can reverse the 'shrink' sound to make a 'grow' sound!

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Songs played backwards quizzes**</span> are music quizzes with a twist. The tracks are reversed, and contestants have to guess the original song — it is not as easy as it sounds. 
</p>

Select the **Wand** sprite and click on the **Sounds** tab.

Right-click (or tap and hold) the 'shrink' sound and choose 'duplicate'.

Name the copy 'grow'.

Click on the **Reverse** icon to make the sound play backwards.

Add a script to the **Wand** sprite to play the 'grow' sound when the 'grow' message is received:

```blocks3
when I receive [grow v]
play sound [grow v] until done
```
