## Introduction

Make an app where you use a magic wand to turn sprites into toads, and grow and shrink them.

You will:
+ Create buttons that `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} messages to other sprites
+ Get multiple sprites to respond when they `receive`{:class="block3events"} the same message
+ Use the `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} blocks menu to reverse sounds

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Broadcasting**</span> and <span style="color: #0faeb0">**receiving**</span> messages is like a call and response pattern in music.

<br>
  "<span style="color: #0faeb0">P3T3 P3T3</span> is a traditional song from Ghana, West Africa. It is performed by one lead person who calls and a group that respond by repeating a key phrase when they hear the call." - <span style="color: #0faeb0">Kwame Bakoji-Hume, African Activities CIC</span>
