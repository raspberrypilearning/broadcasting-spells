## Upgrade your project

How will you expand your magical world? You could:
+ Add more characters
+ Add different sound and visual effects to the wand.
+ Add more spells â€” you could make characters disappear and reappear with `hide`{:class="block3looks"} and `show`{:class="block3looks"}, apply visual effects or turn them upside down.

Why not swap characters with a friend? First, swap project links with a friend to see each other's sprites. To save their sprites, use your Scratch backpack or download the sprites to a shared area. Then go back to your project and add the saved sprites.

Create more spells with a friend and add them to your characters. Decide on which spells to create. Make sure you both use exactly the same name for the messages you broadcast.
